After making a developers account it is very easy to get the data using the `rtweet` package.\n\nClick on the hex `rtweet` logo to access the documentation.\n\n[![](rtweet.png){width=\"200\"}](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/)\n\nFirst you need to make sure you default browser is open and you are logged into your Twitter account. After you do this make sure to install the `rtweet` package and load it in `RStudio`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"rtweet\")\nlibrary(rtweet)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter installing the package and loading it, you can use this code to set up your authentication and the `search_tweets()` function can retrieve Tweet data based on your parameters.\n\nIn this call of `search_tweets()` it will search for Tweets that contain \"rocket league\", `n = 100` means it will return 100 tweets, `include_rts = FALSE` means that it will **not** include and return Retweets, and finally `lang = \"en\"` means it will only return Tweets in English.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nauth_setup_default()\nauth_has_default()\nrt <- search_tweets(\"rocket league\", n = 100, include_rts = FALSE, lang = \"en\")\n```\n:::\n",
