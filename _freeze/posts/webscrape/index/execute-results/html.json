Steam is a video game distribution service, and we will scrape a couple columns from their live *Top games by current player count* table.\n\nFirst of course install and load the packages, if you already have any of these packages then you just need to load them.\n\n## Install and Load Packages\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"rvest\")\ninstall.packages(\"lubridate\")\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## Setting the Parameters\n\nNext you will set up the parameters so `rvest` knows where to get the data from. The `html_nodes` can be found using the browser extension `SelectorGadget` found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb). Using this extension you can highlight what you want to web scrape and copy/paste the html nodes from `SelectorGadget`.\n\n``` r\n# link to get data from\nlink = \"https://store.steampowered.com/stats/\" \n# read webpage at the above link\npage = read_html(link) \n# scrape top 100 games by current players\ngame = page %>% \n  html_nodes(\".gameLink\") %>% \n  html_text()  \n# scrape number of players for each game \ncurrent_players = page %>% \n  html_nodes(\"td:nth-child(1) .currentServers\") %>% \n  html_text() \n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## Creating the Data Frame\n\nAfter getting all the data you will want to put it into a data frame to work with it, so you will then use the `data.frame()` function and add in the data you pulled from online. Below you will see how I am creating the data frame and adding in the current data as a column so I know when I collected this data.\n\n``` r\n# put both game and player data into a data frame\ndf = data.frame(game, current_players) \n# get current date\ncurrent_date <- as_datetime(Sys.Date())\n# update data frame with mutated column that adds current_date\ndf <- df %>% \n  mutate(date = current_date)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets see the first 6 rows of our new data frame that we crafted using `rvest`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                              game current_players       date\n1 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive         508,906 2022-09-17\n2                           Dota 2         435,908 2022-09-17\n3                         Lost Ark         189,549 2022-09-17\n4                     Apex Legends         127,003 2022-09-17\n5                        Destiny 2         111,435 2022-09-17\n6                  Team Fortress 2          97,643 2022-09-17\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
