## **❓ Goals** 
> - This blog is a project I wanted to do in order to **share** `R` **with others**.  
> - I want to share `R` **tutorials**, **tips** and **tricks**.  
> - I also want to use this blog as a portfolio for my work in both `R` and data analytics.  
> - This blog was originally going to be a book titled “*R Cookbook*”. While working on this book it became clearer that a blog would be a **more effective** medium to continuously add and sharecontent.
## **💡 Inspiration**
> When learning and even now, if I do not know how to make a specific visual or do somethign in `R`, then I *Google* it. I would then come across books like [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/), and many different websites like [The R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html), which explained in detial how different parameters or elements work, and then showed `R` vignettes of the code. This would solve my problem or allow me to continue, and then next time I have another "*road block*" I will go and restart the process. 
>  
> This learning process continuing, I began to notice how **useful** these resources were, and that made me want to create my own "*R Cookbook*" which would allow me share what I have learned to **help others**.
## **📐 Methods**
> Tools I am using:
> - `RStudio` and `Quarto` to create the blog.
> - `GitHub Pages` to host the blog.
> - `GitHub` for version control.
