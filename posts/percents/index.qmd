## **Use Formattable for Percent Signs**

Have you wanted to create a visual or table, and struggled to figure out how to change decimals to percents in R?

### The Formattable Package

Here is how you install and load the package, and you can [click here](https://renkun-ken.github.io/formattable/) to see the documentation.

``` r
install.packages("formattable")
library(formattable)
```

I will also be loading the `tidyverse` and `janitor` packages in the background.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
iris_df <- iris %>%
  clean_names()
```

### Adding Percents

Here is how you would break down the `iris` dataset by species, using the `formattable` package to get percents of each species.

```{r}
iris_df %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(cnt = n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = formattable::percent(cnt / sum(cnt)))
```
