This is my first post in my Quarto blog. This blog is made in RStudio using Quarto, and is hosted via GitHub Pages.

I have been practicing with Quarto for a couple of weeks now, and have enjoyed it so much! Quarto has created many more opportunities for myself and the types of deliverable I can create. If you are using R or Python and have not gotten to use Quarto yet, then this is your sign to look into how awesome it is!
