## **'Scraping' Twitter**

Tons of data is created on social media, and using social media can be a great source for businesses to see how their customers may feel about the goods or services they offer, advertise more products or intervene when a customer had a bad experience.

You can access data from Twitter by making a [Twitter Developer's Account](https://developer.twitter.com/en) and by using the Twitter API. After making a developers account it is very easy to get the data using the `rtweet` package. Click on the hex `rtweet` logo to access the documentation.

First you need to make sure you default browser is open and you are logged into your Twitter account. After you do this make sure to install the `rtweet` package and load it in `RStudio`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rtweet")
library(rtweet)
```

After installing the package and loading it, you can use this code to set up your authentication and the `search_tweets()` function can retrieve Tweet data based on your parameters.

In this call of `search_tweets()` it will search for Tweets that contain "rocket league", `n = 100` means it will return 100 tweets, `include_rts = FALSE` means that it will **not** include and return Retweets, and finally `lang = "en"` means it will only return Tweets in English.

```{r eval=FALSE}
auth_setup_default()
auth_has_default()
rt <- search_tweets("rocket league", n = 100, include_rts = FALSE, lang = "en")
```
