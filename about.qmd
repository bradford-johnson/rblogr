My name is Bradford Johnson, I love working with data and I taught myself `R`. This blog is a project I wanted to do in order to share R with others. I want to share R tutorials, tips and tricks, and also use it as a portfolio for my work in R and data analytics in general.

This blog was originally going to be a book titled "R Cookbook". While working on this book it became clearer that a blog would be a more effective medium to continuously update and add content to indefinitely.

The tutorials and content may vary as they will mostly contain concepts and solutions that relate to what I am currently working on. If you have any content recommendations or feedback, please reach out and message me!
